        <h1>The Chinese Zodiac</h1>
        <p>     The Chinese Zodiac is known as 生肖 (shēngxiào) in Mandarin Chinese. The Chinese Zodiac is based on a 12-year cycle, with each year represented by an animal.</p>

        <p>The 12-year cycle of the Chinese Zodiac is based on the traditional Chinese lunar calendar. In this calendar, the first day of the year usually falls on the second new moon after the winter solstice. On New Year's day, we enter a new Chinese zodiac cycle, which follows this order:</p>

        <ol id="zodiaclist" align="center">
            <li>Rat - 鼠 - shǔ</li>
            <li>Ox - 牛 - niú</li>
            <li>Tiger - 虎 - hǔ</li>
            <li>Rabbit - 兔 - tù</li>
            <li>Dragon - 龍 - lóng</li>
            <li>Snake - 蛇 - shé</li>
            <li>Horse - 馬 / 马 - mǎ</li>
            <li>Ram - 羊 - yáng</li>
            <li>Monkey - 猴 - hóu</li>
            <li>Chicken - 雞 / 鸡 - jī</li>
            <li>Dog - 狗 - gǒu</li>
            <li>Pig - 豬 / 猪 - zhū</li>
         </ol><br>
    
        <p>As with many Chinese traditions, there is a story attached to the types of animals and the order they appear in the Chinese Zodiac. The Jade Emperor (玉皇 - Yù Huáng), according to Chinese myth, governs all of heaven and earth. He was so busy ruling the universe that he had no time to visit earth. He wished to know what the animals of earth looked like, so he invited them all to his heavenly palace for a banquet.</p>
        <p>The cat was fond of sleeping but did not want to miss the banquet, so he asked his friend the rat to be sure to wake him on the day of the banquet. The rat, however, was jealous of the cat's beauty and was afraid of being judged ugly by the Jade Emperor, so he let the cat sleep.</p>
        <p>As the animals arrived in heaven, the Jade Emperor was so impressed with them that he decided to give each one their own year, arranged by the order they had arrived.</p>
        <p>The cat, of course, had missed the banquet and was furious with the rat for letting him sleep, and that is why rats and cats are enemies to this day.</p>
